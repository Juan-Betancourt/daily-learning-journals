Reflecting back to the first day I have come a long way. Previously I was reading the book a smarter way to learn JavaScript and GitHub Essentials. However, at the present time I know the majority of things in the book to include Constructors, Prototypes, functions, loops etc. Learning vanilla JavaScripts sets the foundation for my next adventure.
