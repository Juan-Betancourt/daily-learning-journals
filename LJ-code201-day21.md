#LJ Code 201 - Day 21

In my previous career, my experience with the Air Force was fantastic, and there was a cornucopia of training to meet or exceed the standards of civilian companies. Furthermore, the training included a variety of sources and different techniques to learn. However, Code Fellows is a stack learning environment which requires one to learn new ways of obtaining persistent information.

My current journey with Code Fellows has been up and down like most things when learning something new. However, John Sonmez, from Simple programmer once said, You could never give up on coding because you don't see a baby stop attempting from walking. Every time a baby falls they get back up and try again, and you should do the same.

Overall, excitement grows every day as a future software developer, and I hope to have a clear understanding of all the fundamental concepts by the end of 201. I learn in a different way where I prefer to see and understand the why behind coding, but at the moment I prefer a language that is structured such as C++ or C#.
